"""
Parametric SFR above-core structure (ACS).

Axially-stacked assembly: bottom ring + tapered cone + neck + top cylinder,
all revolved about the local Z axis.

Geometry:
  • Lower shell (z=0 to z=bottom_ring_height+cone_height+neck_height)
    - Bottom ring, cone, neck revolved about Z axis (hollow, uniform wall_t)
  • Top cylinder (above the neck)
    - Solid cylinder of radius top_cyl_outer_r and height top_cyl_height
    - Can be offset from the Z axis via top_cyl_offset_x/y

The lower shell stays centered on the Z axis so it aligns with the reactor
core via center_coords. The top cylinder offset allows clearance around
nearby components (IHX, pumps).

Axial dimensions (all unitless):
  • bottom_ring_height      — height of the bottom ring
  • cone_height             — height of the cone
  • neck_height             — height of the straight neck section
  • top_cyl_height          — height of the top cylinder
  Total height = sum of the above four parameters

#     - Bottom ring, cone, neck revolved about Z axis (hollow, uniform wall_t)
#   • Top cylinder (above the neck)
#     - Solid cylinder of radius top_cyl_outer_r and height top_cyl_height

# The lower shell stays centered on the Z axis so it aligns with the reactor
# core via center_coords. The top cylinder offset allows clearance around
# nearby components (IHX, pumps).
